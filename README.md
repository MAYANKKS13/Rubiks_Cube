# Rubik-s-Cube



The different methods by which we can solve a Rubik's Cube are:-
<UL><LI>Beginner Method.</LI>
<LI>CFOF Method</LI>
<LI>Roux Method</LI>
<LI>Z Method</LI>
<LI>Old Pochmann Method (For Blindfolded Solving)</LI></UL> <br><br>

In this method, Cube is solved layer by layer. First layer is solved by solving the edges or making a cross and then placing the corners. Then the 4 edge cubie is placed at right place end up solving the 2nd layer. At last, last layer is solved by making the cross, permutating the corners and then orienting the corners and up solving the cube. <br><br>

#### Step 1:- The Cross     
  
<p>First step in solving the Rubik's Cube is to make cross on the first layer. It means that we have to place the 4 edges of the top layer correctly matching with the respective colours of the center pieces of the cube. This is how the cube should be after making cross.</p>

<p>This step is completely intuitive. One can solve for each cubie logically.   
One thing you have to keep in mind only that if solving for an edge is disturbing the solved edges, then one should do some setup moves, then solve for the edge and then undo the setup move.  As this step is completely intuitive, there are certain cases that occur for which you can do some moves to make the edges solve correctly.  These are at max two cases that may make beginner a little difficult.  Just do these moves to make the edges solve. </p>

#### Step 2:- The Corners

Now after making the cross, we have to pkace the four corners of the top layer into their respective correct positions.
